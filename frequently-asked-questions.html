                    <p>Additionally, for bank statements, please note that the only acceptable formats are:</p><br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Screenshots of full pages of your PDF bank statement</li>

                    <p>We are a new age and innovative company using new age technology. Our machines learn well and are super adaptive.

                <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade in" id="vtab3">
                    <h4>3.1 What is the minimum and maximum loan amount?</h4>
                    <p>You can borrow in multiples of Rs. 1,000 from Rs. 8,000/- to Rs. 100,000/-.</p><br>
                    <h4>3.2 What is the minimum and maximum loan period /How is the repayment date determined/Why don’t I see all the dates in the repayment date option?</h4>
                    <p>You can apply for loans ranging 7 to 50 days. We would like to ensure that you avoid defaulting your repayment and lowering your score. Hence your options to choose a repayment date would be limited to a few working days on/after your salary date.</p><br>
                    <p>Since banks do not permit repayments on bank holidays, your repayment dates list will not include bank holidays. However, if you have money in your account and are ready to repay your loan you can do so at no additional cost! Also, you will pay interest only up to the day on which you repay.</p><br>
                    <h4>3.3 How many loans can I take at a time?</h4>
                    <p>We sanction the highest amount you would be able to comfortably repay each month. Hence you can take only one loan at a time.</p><br>
                    <h4>3.4 Can I borrow more money on my existing loan/Can I Top-Up my loan account?</h4>
                    <p>If you already have a loan outstanding, but need some extra money, you can borrow more money while keeping the same repayment date, if you did not borrow all the money sanctioned.</p><br>
                    <h4>3.5 How many loans can I take in a year/Why should I wait between two loans for 5 days?</h4>
                    <p>Though we are a new age banking company, our vision and perspectives are shaped from socially responsible business leaders.</p><br>
                    <p>While we wish to help you with money as and when you need it, we strive not to make YOU addicted to loans. Hence, you may apply for as many loans as you require per year. Further, between the repayment date of your current loan and the application date of your next loan, there should be a minimum gap of 5 days.</p><br>
                    <h4>3.6 How much is a loan going to cost me?</h4>
                    <p>You do not have to pay any fee upfront! Isn’t that good news to start with…? Use the sliders on our app to see the amount real time. If you still haven’t downloaded the app yet, you can play with the sliders here.</p><br>
                    <p>In addition to interest, the fees and charges include:</p><br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Processing Fees:<br>Processing Fee for the Loan shall not exceed<br>

                    <h4>3.7 How can I apply for a loan/What is the application process/How much time will you take?</h4>
                    <p>We are a new age company for the young Indians. Forget the monotonous lengthy boxed forms, the continuous follow up and the endless waiting your parents went through for their loans. With your social logins, you will hardly have to key in 5 data points, upload a few images and sign an agreement – all of which should not take you over a few minutes. At YOUR desired time we will come to your house/office to get your signature and we’ll transfer the money right away.
                    From the second time you take a loan from us, money would reach your account in not more than a few minutes.
                    While applying the first time you will go through these 5 steps:</p><br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Quickly skim through the mostly pre-filled app pages, key in the minimal data left, and upload your bank statements. Quickly rehearse your moves for the night or pack your bags for a hell of a trip. In a few minutes your loan would be sanctioned.</li>
                      <li>Once sanctioned, Choose the amount you would like to hit your bank account and upload few more images. Perfect your dance moves and ensure that you have packed everything.In minutes we will e-mail you your loan agreement and will ask you to confirm a time and place to sign your loan agreement (RBI needs this!).</li>
                      <li>Once you confirm your availability, we will come running to you, within an hour or at the time you choose. You better dress up for the night or for your trip!</li>
                      <li>Once our officer reaches your house/office, he will check an original ID proof (one that you submitted) and will get your signatures on some papers.</li>
                      <li>Sit in your car and start your engine for one of the best moments of your life. We would have transferred the money to your bank account. The money would reach your account according to the time your bank takes!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The whole process should not take more than a Business Days’ time to complete.</p><br>
                    <h4>3.8 Why should I sign the agreement only at my residence/office?</h4>
                    <p>To add to your comfort, to validate your address we’ll have to visit you at either your residence or office only.</p><br>
                    <h4>3.9 Why should I show an original ID to the Early Salary Officer who visits me?</h4>
                    <p>We’ll need to inspect the original ID to validate your identity and to ensure that fraudsters don’t harm an innocent citizen.</p><br>
                    <h4>3.10  Should I be concerned about my safety as a stranger would visit my residence/office?</h4>
                    <p>YOUR safety is our priority. Our lendpaisa officer would be sporting the lendpaisa uniform and will carry his ID card. Moreover our carefully hand-picked field officers have undergone stringent background checks and their movements are tracked the whole time by our machines! So bravely greet them with a smile while they smile at you!</p><br>

                    <h4>4.1 How can I repay the loan?</h4>
                    <p>Easy peasy! We use ECS/NACH (National Automated Clearing House) to take repayment automatically. On the repayment date, we will debit your bank account registered with us. Just make sure that you have enough money in your bank account on that day.</p><br>
                    <h4>4.2 From which bank account will my money be deducted/Can I change the bank account from which my money will be deducted?</h4>
                    <p>Your repayment amount (including all interest and charges) would be deducted only from your salary bank account registered with us. We currently do not have the option to change the bank account registered with us at the time of applying for the loan.</p><br>
                    <h4>4.3 Can I Pre-Pay my loan/Will I be charged for repayment?</h4>
                    <p>Rejoice! There is no pre-payment fee at the moment. You can pre-pay your loan any time before the repayment date through net banking. Tap the Repay button on the app. You will be charged only for the amount outstanding so by prepaying, you can save money! Please note that pre-payment is only possible before 2 bank business days from the repayment date. Post this date, we’ll use the ECS/NACH facility to take repayment automatically so that you do not have to worry.</p><br>
                    <h4>4.4 Can I Pre-Pay using a credit card?</h4>
                    <p>Sorry pal! As per RBI guidelines, you can’t pay your dues using a Credit Card.</p><br>
                    <h4>4.5 Can I post pone my repayment date?</h4>
                    <p>No you can’t! You have to repay in one shot.</p><br>
                    <h4>4.6 Yikes! What if there isn’t enough money in my salary bank account on my repayment date?</h4>
                    <p>We suggest that you call us and extend your repayment date. However, if your extension request is rejected, please pay us to the extent possible before 2 bank days from the repayment date to avoid maximum charges. This way we’ll charge you additional charges only on the unpaid portion.
                    If your account is still short of funds on the day of repayment, then a late payment fees in addition to ECS bounce charges will be charged as per the schedule. You may also be charged additional interest for the delayed payment.</p><br>
                    <h4>4.7 Is repayment through EMIs possible?</h4>
                    <p>EMI option is currently not available. We’ll be launching the EMI facility very soon.</p><br>
                    <h4>4.8 What happens if I do not repay on time? Does lendpaisa report to the Credit bureaus?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, we are obligated to report our Loan, its history, the late payment and non-payment of dues to credit bureaus such as CIBIL and Equifax. This will impact your chances of getting banking products. By paying on time, your score improves and so does your chances of getting a credit card or any loan!!!</p><br>
